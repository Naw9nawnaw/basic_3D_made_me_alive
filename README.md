“**basic_3D_made_me_alive**” [finished on Mar. 13, 2024] is an audio-reactive visualizer piece of p5js. I made FFT, torus, ribbon, 3D grid boxes and cat.obj for fun in it. It is after I explore the xyz motion trajectory of a real coin spinning on a table in "**Torus_Coin_Animation**".

Selected For Persephone - Yiting.mp3 was added also which was an excerpt of the track _For Persephone_ from my unreleased album _People Need Belief_. You can play it or choose other music when playing the sketch.
