“**basic_3D_made_me_alive**” [finished on Mar. 13, 2024] is an audio-reactive visualizer piece of p5js. I made FFT, torus, ribbon, 3D grid boxes with bubbles and cat.obj for fun in it. It is after I explore the xyz motion trajectory of a real coin spinning on a table in "**Torus_Coin_Animation**".

After opening it, a loud sound like tapping on the side of the computer is required to make the animation appear first (try more tappings or other loud sounds if the grid boxes and other animation do not appear); you can click and drag to see different viewpoints in the 3D world and zoom in and out. After seeing all the animations, play the music. _Selected For Persephone - Yiting.mp3_ responds well and can see the final result. When played in different spaces and using different speakers, the bubbles' reactions and effects can be a little different.

Selected For Persephone - Yiting.mp3 is an addition that was an excerpt of the track _For Persephone_ from my unreleased album _People Need Belief_. You can play it or choose other music when playing the sketch.
